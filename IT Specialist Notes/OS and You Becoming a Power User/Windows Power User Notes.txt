WINDOWS POWER USER NOTES:

---Create, Modify, and Remove File and Folder Permissions in Windows---

Use ICACLS to view the existing permissions for the file using this command. ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\important_document

You can remove her entirely from the file's permissions and check to see that it worked with these commands: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\important_document /remove "Kara", ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\important_document
As you can see, Kara is no longer listed in the file's permissions. To re-grant her only the read permission, use this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\important_document /grant "Kara:(r)"
Now the file's permissions should be set correctly, with Kara only having read permissions. You can double check this with the earlier command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\important_document

You can view the current permissions with this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Secret\

First, give Phoebe read access. You can grant her these permissions with the command below, like before. Then, use the previous command again to verify that the change has been made: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Secret\ /grant "Phoebe:(r)", ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Secret\

The next step is to grant Kara write permissions. You don't need to remove her existing permissions first, like you did before; you only need to add "write" to her existing permissions with this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Secret\ /grant "Kara:(w)"
Now the file should have the required permissions. View them to verify this with the following command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Secret\

Your goal for this example is to change the permissions for this folder so that the "Everyone" group only has read permission (not write). As usual, view the current permissions with this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Music\

You can change permissions for groups in exactly the same way as you do for users. To remove the group's current permissions, and then re-grant them a read permission, use these commands: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Music\ /remove "Everyone", ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Music\ /grant "Everyone:(r)"
The "Everyone" group should now have only read permissions, which you can check using the same command as before: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Music\

View the current permissions with this command, to see what the starting point for this file is: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\not_so_important_document
This will show you that the "Authenticated Users" group is currently not listed. This means that the only step required is to grant them write access, which you can do with this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\not_so_important_document /grant "Authenticated Users:(w)"
That should successfully grant them write permissions. You can use the same command as earlier to verify that the commands were a success: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\not_so_important_document

In this final example, you'll change the permissions of another file in the "Documents" folder. The file named "public_document" needs to be made publically readable, so that anyone on the system is able to read it. As usual, view the file's commands first: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\public_document
The easiest way to make sure that all users on the system have read permissions is to add those permissions to the "Everyone" group. You could also add each user manually, but by giving the group the permissions instead, you save time; it removes the need to go back and edit permissions again if a new user is created in the future. Grant every user on the system the ability to read the file using this command: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\public_document /grant "Everyone:(r)"
Finally, view the permissions again to make sure it worked: ICACLS C:\Users\Qwiklab\Documents\public_document

Archiving files with Powershell: Compress-Archive -Path Earth, Mercury, Venus Planets.zip

Installing Chocolatey: Unregister-PackageSource -Name chocolatey, Then you can re-register Chocolatey, so that it can be installed using this command: Register-PackageSource -Name chocolatey -ProviderName Chocolatey -Location http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/

Using Chocolatey to install VLC: Install-Package -Name vlc -Source chocolatey, Get-Package -Name vlc

Uninstalling GIMP: Choco Uninstall GIMP, You can verify this with the following command and seeing that GIMP is not listed: Get-Package



---Maintaining Efficient Process Utilization on Windows---

Terminating a specific process: Get-Process -Name 'totally_not_malicious', Each row represents a process, and one of the columns shows the process ID. To end a process, you can use taskkill and specify the Process ID, or PID, of the process: taskkill /PID [PROCESS ID], To verify that the process is no longer running, you can search for it again: Get-Process -Name 'totally_not_malicious'

You can use "wildcards" (asterisks) to look for processes: Get-Process -Name '*razzle*', You can use taskkill, like before, once for each of the "razzle" processes: taskkill /PID [PROCESS ID]
